Some come here to sit and think, I'm only here to shit and stink

Here I sit and contemplate, should I shit or mastrubate

Her I sit broken hearted, came to shit but only farted
Later on I had my chance, tried to fart and shit my pants

Hurried here but what is this, I can't seem to take a piss

In the days of old
when nights were cold
and toilets weren't invented
they laid their load upon the road
and walked away contented

Sitting on the toilet
Trying to take a doody
But when the doody hit the water
The water hit my booty

Here you sit and read these walls
while my crabs invade your balls
